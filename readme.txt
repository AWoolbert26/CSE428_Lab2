    Steps 1-6:
     - These went smoothly. Didn't run into any issues while setting up the lab.

    Step 7:
     - Accidentally called the two functions the same thing which lead to an error when making. Fixed this quite easily.

    Step 8:
     - I decided to use the default copy constructor which the compiler provides rather than declare and define my own. The one that the compiler supplies is sufficient

       less complex.

    Step 9:
